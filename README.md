# Learning React JS Library



### React Library:
- **JSX (JavaScript XML):** Write HTML elements directly within JavaScript.
- **Components:**
  - Functional Components for simplicity.
  - Class-based Components for complex functionality.
- **Props and State:** Manage dynamic data flow and state within components.
- **Event Handling:** Efficiently handle user actions like clicks, inputs, etc.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Control component rendering phases (Class Components).
- **Hooks:** Utilize `useState`, `useEffect`, and more for managing state and side effects.

### Advanced React:
- **Context API:** Share state across components without props drilling.
- **React Router:** Navigate between pages in a single-page application.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Dynamically render UI based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys:** Efficiently render lists and ensure proper component updates.

### Tailwind CSS Framework:
- Build responsive, utility-first, and modern UIs.
